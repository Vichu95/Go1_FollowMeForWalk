This package is used as base in the Nvidia 13 board(N13).
Base is taken from Dafa's work on 12 March 2024.
From that the packages 'go1_arm_ikfast_plugin' and 'go1_moveit' are deleted. (manual deletion from the src folder)

Also the related launch files are also removed from bringup files.





Testing : 
The teleoperation worked considering N13 as the MASTER. Every node ran in the N13.

But only with N14 as MASTER, we were able to receive the raw lidar data as topic.
